This Repo contains the following Matlab files:

*ar_ml.m* was used to compute the AR(1) models from fMRI time series (Eq. (1) in Liégeois et al, 2019)\
*get_heritability.m* was used to compute the behavioral variance explained by static and dynamic FC markers (Figures 1-4 in Liégeois et al., 2019)\
*get_individual_effects.m* was used to evaluate the contribution of each FC connections in explaining behavioral variance (Figure 5 in Liégeois et al., 2019)
